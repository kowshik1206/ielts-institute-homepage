## 📤 Steps to Push to GitHub

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [https://github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
2. **Repository name**: `ielts-institute-homepage` (or your choice)
3. **Description**: "IELTS Institute Homepage - React + Vite + Tailwind CSS"
4. ⚠️ **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
5. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Copy the Commands

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. **Use these:**

```powershell
# Add your GitHub repository as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git

# Push your code
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Run the Commands

Open **PowerShell** in your project folder and run:

```powershell
# Navigate to project directory
cd C:\Users\Kowshik\Desktop\assignment\ielts-institute

# Add your remote (replace with YOUR repository URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git

# Rename branch to main
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## 🎯 Quick Commands (Copy & Paste)

Replace `YOUR-USERNAME` and `YOUR-REPO-NAME` with your actual values:

```powershell
cd C:\Users\Kowshik\Desktop\assignment\ielts-institute
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Error: "remote origin already exists"
